# Usage

Register routes in your application using your preferred method:

- in `config/routes.php`
- per-module, using a `RoutesDelegator`

Both methods will provide access to the application's container via the `$container` variable.

There are two types of routes that you can create:

- [create a single route](./tutorials/create-single-route.md)
- [create a route group](./tutorials/create-route-group.md)
